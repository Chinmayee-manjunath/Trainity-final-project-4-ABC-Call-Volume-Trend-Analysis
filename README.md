# Trainity-final-project-4-ABC-Call-Volume-Trend-Analysis

In this project, you'll be diving into the world of Customer Experience (CX) analytics, specifically focusing on the inbound calling team of a company. You'll be provided with a dataset that spans 23 days and includes various details such as the agent's name and ID, the queue time (how long a customer had to wait before connecting with an agent), the time of the call, the duration of the call, and the call status (whether it was abandoned, answered, or transferred).
